					<p>I was born into a family of three in a small town in Oyo State in Nigeria. My parents were hardworking, but we didn't have much money. They both had jobs, but their income was barely enough to cover our basic needs. As a child, I often helped my parents with household chores and errands. I did the dishes, cleaned the house, and ran errands to the market. I also helped my mother with cooking, and I remember how we used to sit together and grind pepper and tomatoes to prepare meals.
					Despite the challenges, my parents instilled in me the value of education. They knew that it was the key to a better future, and they encouraged me to study hard and excel in school.
					I took their advice seriously and worked hard in school. I was an avid reader and enjoyed learning new things. I would often read through my textbooks and take notes, even after completing my homework.
					My parents supported me in every way they could, but I knew that my dream of going to university to study Computer Science was beyond our means. We simply couldn't afford the tuition and other expenses associated with tertiary education. But I never gave up. I continued to study hard, hoping for a chance to make my dream a reality.
					Finally, I got my chance. I was awarded a scholarship to study Computer Science at the University of Ibadan. It was a dream come true, and I was determined to make the most of this opportunity.
					As I look back on my life before school, I realize how my humble upbringing and my parents' encouragement shaped the person I am today. I am grateful for the lessons I learned and the values I acquired. And I know that with hard work and determination, I can achieve anything I set my mind to.</p>

					<p>After years of hard work and determination, I finally received an acceptance letter from the University of Ibadan. I was overjoyed I knew that this was my chance to make a better life for myself and my family.
						The first few weeks of school were overwhelming. The campus was huge, and I felt like a small fish in a big pond. But as I settled into my classes and met other students, I began to feel more at home.
						Studying Computer Science was challenging, but I was determined to succeed. I spent long hours in the library, poring over textbooks and practicing my coding skills. I also volunteered at tech conferences and startups as gaining hands-on experience that would serve me well in my future career. 
						Despite the demands of my coursework, I made time for extracurricular activities. I joined a student club that focused on community service, and I helped organize a tech outreach where we taught secondary school students the different areas in tech they could venture into and beleive me it was a wonderful experience for me. 
						As I look back on my journey, I am grateful for the opportunities that the University of Ibadan has given me. I know that I still have a long way to go, but I am confident that with hard work and determination, I can achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the world.
